# Wearable Sensing LSL

Welcome to the Wearable Sensing LSL (Lab Streaming Layer) project! This codebase provides compiled GUIs and clients for interfacing with Wearable Sensing devices using the Lab Streaming Layer protocol. While the source code is not included, you can find that on the main LSL repository for Wearable Sensing [here](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/App-WearableSensing).

The purpose of this repository is to provide a convenient way to access and use the Wearable Sensing LSL clients without needing to compile them from source or wait for the main repository to be updated. This is particularly useful for users who want to quickly get started with Wearable Sensing devices and LSL without dealing with the complexities of building from source.

## Releases

Please see the Releases section of this repository for the latest compiled binaries. Each release includes the necessary files to run the Wearable Sensing LSL clients on a Windows machine.

## Documentation

Coming soon! In the meantime, you can refer to the Lab Streaming Layer documentation [here](https://labstreaminglayer.readthedocs.io/) or reach out to us for support.
